            Hello! My name is Jose Antonio Rodriguez Coa and I am from Anzoátegui, Venezuela.

        <p>"The Dimitrios Demu Museum is located in the city of Lechería in the state of Anzoátegui,
            Venezuela.
            The museum was inaugurated in 1999, with its construction financed by businessman
            Nicolás Demu,
            the
            brother of the aforementioned artist. The architectural design of the museum was
            conceived by
            Venezuelan architect Fruto Vivas, with the intention of serving as a venue for the
            exhibition of
            the
            artist's oeuvre and the promotion of Greek-Romanian-Venezuelan culture. The edifice's
            configuration
            defies conventional norms, bearing a resemblance to the shape of a UFO. The designation
            of the
            museum as a cultural heritage site of the city is, at least in part, attributable to the
            author's
            contributions."</p>
